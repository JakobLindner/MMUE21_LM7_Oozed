Oozed is a small platformer for Android, which was developed during the course *Multimedia* at *Vienna University of Technology*. The goal was to develop a video game using only the Android API. No game engines and frameworks were allowed. Sprite and sound game assets were made from scratch.

## Authors

## Story
You are a mad scientist who accidentally transformed himself into a slime and fell into the sewage system. Now you have to get back into the laboratory where the antidote is. However as you secured your own lab with countless traps and monsters, this is no easy task. You even installed a new experiment that messes with gravity but that might come in handy after all. Also you know that you have to constantly move so that the lasers canâ€™t target you.

## Controls
